This jQuery\r\nplugin allows you to do that.\r\n\r\nSimply include changedotorg.js on the page where your form is, set a few data\r\nattributes on your form element (see the examples), and then write a server-side\r\nto process the form results.\r\n\r\nYou could probably process form results in a variety of languages, but PHP is\r\nincluded here because its what Change.org offers as an example, and PHP powers\r\nsome of the most popular CMSes out there.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to use a server-side script like one of the examples because\r\nChange.org requires an API secret, and sending that to the client, unencrypted\r\nwould be a big no-no.\r\n\r\nBecause this plugin was written for a project that was running in Drupal 6 on \r\njQuery 1.2.6 (a dinosaur), I have also included a branch of this project that \r\nis compatible with such jQuery relics.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
